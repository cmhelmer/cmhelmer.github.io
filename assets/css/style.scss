# Notes:	Mobile-first, content-first. Mobile-first means it was designed for 320px wide devices first, then enhanced for device widths up to 1280px (configurable). Content-first means the ideal reading situation was designed first (font-size, line-height, line-length, white-space), then built out. For example, `box-sizing` is kept at default `content-box` and not changed site-wide to `border-box` in order for content to dictate sizes; box sizes are also set relative to font-size.)
