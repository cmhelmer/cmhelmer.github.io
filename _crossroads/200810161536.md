# Article about Church and Campus Ministry

Crossroads,

We’ve been talking recently about the purpose of the Church in general and about Crossroads. What is God’s purpose for the church? One reason Crossroads to the Nations was started is because we believe that disciples are best made in the context of a church — not a campus ministry, Bible study or building. The church is a vital part of God’s unfolding mystery in the universe, even with all its flaws. It is what Jesus died for and where his Spirit is present among believers. It is where cultures are crossed (and there is sure to be some friction in that) and where the cross makes a new culture.

I thought seminary professor Dr. Russell Moore reminded me of these things in a recent article. Take time to read this and share your thoughts:

Thanks for joining together in Christ’s name!  
C.
