# Psalms 134

Family,

The world of the disciples came crashing down in a mess of suffering and scattering. “You will all fall away,” Jesus told them, “for it is written: ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’ But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you…” (Mk. 14:27–28). Jesus told them He would rise again to life, but what man could rise from death?

Oh, but what faith and worship and joy must have flooded their hearts this Sunday morning! “‘Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here; he has risen! Remember how he told you, while he was still with you in Galilee: “The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, be crucified and on the third day be raised again.”’ Then they remember his words” (Lk. 24:6–8). He is risen! His words are true! Be revived today and worship! Jesus is God!

The psalmist calls us to worship: “Praise the Lord!” (Ps. 134:1). When the disciples beheld Jesus there, alive, victorious and glorious, they did not need to be commanded to worship; they worshiped.

Praise the Lord!
