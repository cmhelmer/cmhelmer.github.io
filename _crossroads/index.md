# Crossroads to the Nations Church

These notes were written from 2005–2009 for Crossroads to the Nations Church (crossroadstothenations.org) where I served as a pastor.

Crossroads met in homes with international students and missions-minded seminary students in Louisville, KY. It no longer meets. Many of it’s members serve around the world. Crossroads gave me a love for the local church and church planting, an intention to build other fellowships like it where there are yet none.
