# Church is meeting at BCM building!

Church,

This morning H—— and I have been trying to call all of you, and maybe this message will reach a few more today. Our church meeting tonight will be a great celebration (that’s just what church is supposed to be!), and we’ll be seeing people we haven’t seen in a while. There will be too many for H——’s apartment (H—— said we would be probably break the fire code or fall through the floor to the lower apartment). It’s about time to meet in another place.

Church will meet tonight (Feb. 4) at the BCM/BSU building at the University of Louisville campus. Many of you know where that is, but if you need directions, just call H—— or M——. Meet there at 5pm.

Hope to see you all there!  
C.
