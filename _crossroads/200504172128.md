# Thunder Over Louisville!

Hey Crossroads family…

We are going to be a part of Thunder Over Louisville this Saturday, one of the most exciting events in the area all year. Our church meeting will be moved to where the people are: at Waterfront Park. This is a great step for us! We will be available to talk to international students and we’ll have a time of prayer and worship like we usually do. D—— will be setting up in the wee early morning hours, so we can have a place to meet.

I’ll try to organize everyone: send me your cellphone numbers please if you have one! We need to call you to tell where we found a place to meet. And check your email early Saturday; we’ll give you directions in an email after we set-up.

We will get together around 3pm, so we have some time before, but come as early as you can… you won’t regret it! Our church meeting will be at 5pm. Also, bring a meal (if you want to eat) or buy expensive food there (but you can try the funnel cakes with M——). Everything else is free (the fun, the music, the fireworks, the people to minister to)!

Write back with any questions. See you soon!

In Christ,  
C.
