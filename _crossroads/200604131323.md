# Psalms 131

Family,

Today we observe “Holy Thursday” (also sometimes called “Maundy Thursday”), the day Jesus ate His Last Supper with His disciples. Extraordinary things happened that night: Jesus washed His own disciples’ dirty feet; He instituted the new covenant during the meal (which is why we eat the “Lord’s Supper” in remembrance); and, according to John’s gospel, Jesus offered His last teaching and prayer for His disciples (John 13–17). This night marks the steepest part of the “ascent.” The Passover had come, and it was time (in the whole history of the world!) for the Passover Lamb of God to be sacrificed. Despite incredible anguish and abandonment, there was no other way; Jesus, the One and Only, did it willingly.

Let your trust in the Lord be child-like; have a quiet confidence in His arms. Cultivate this stillness and dependence, and let Psalms 131 guide you.

Prayerfully,  
C.

> **Psalms 131**  
> *A song of ascents. Of David.*
> 
> 1 My heart is not proud, O LORD,  
> my eyes are not haughty;  
> I do not concern myself with great matters  
> or things too wonderful for me.
> 
> 2 But I have stilled and quieted my soul;  
> like a weaned child with its mother,  
> like a weaned child is my soul within me.
> 
> 3 O Israel, put your hope in the LORD  
> both now and forevermore.
