# Crossroads Prayer

Crossroads Family,

I thought it would be a good time to send out a message. We should be praying for three things:

- J—— is having gall bladder surgery Thursday (7/14). The operation will be at 1:30pm. She hasn’t had anything this major before; let’s pray for peace for her, and a smooth recovery! We’ll understand if we don’t see you for few days, J——, but we do hope to see you soon!
- Our “missionaries”: D—— and M—— are returning this week! Also, S—— and D—— are now ministering in Central Asia. How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news. Please remember them in your prayers.
- Lastly, continue praying for the direction of the church and international student ministry. Not only is the next school year coming (with lots of new students and opportunities), but we still have a bit of summer ahead of us! May the Lord use it all!

Thanks for helping to uphold our church family!

Shalom,  
The Helmers
