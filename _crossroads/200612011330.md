# Special Church Meeting This Sunday

Church,

God has given us a great opportunity to worship and fellowship together. This Sunday, Dec 3, is our special fellowship with other churches (two other house churches, New Covenant Fellowship, and Ekklesia). It will take place instead of our meeting at H——’s, so be sure to tell others about it so no one goes to H——’s.

Here are a few more important things to know:

- **Time:** set-up (tables and chairs for about 100 people) will begin at 4:30; dinner is at 5; the meeting is at 6:15. We will be finished by 8:30.
- **Food:** please bring food to pass; a small dish or side dish (vegetable, salad, for examples) would be great. The more the merrier…

Of course, you can call us or call one another to drive together. It will probably take 15 minutes to get there for most of you. And this should be an especially welcome celebration for those of you who finished their final exams this week!

Hope to see you soon!  
C.
