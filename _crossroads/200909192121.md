# What will you bring to church this Sunday?

Church,

What will you bring to share at church this Sunday? A Scripture, a song, a story of God’s work and grace?

> Speaking the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work. (Eph. 4:15–16)

Share to build up others. Do this whether in Louisville or far away when you meet with God’s people. It’s the God-given way of maturity into Christ.

I look forward to meeting! Your brother,  
C.
