# Mission to the Dominican Republic this week!

M—— left yesterday with a team from the BCM to serve in the Dominican Republic. They’ll be there until Monday, giving clean water, care, visitation to the hospitalized, and children’s ministry. We had neglected to give towards M——’s mission earlier, and so on Sunday we happily and quickly agreed to give $500 toward her expenses. Please pray for this team throughout the week!

Thanks again,  
C.
