# Psalm 122

Family,

How are you walking this week? The Lord watches over us, keeping us, and keeping our feet firm. Walk with Him to the New Jerusalem.

Pray for: J——, who is leading an important IESL study today. Her students will be hearing about the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus between now and Easter; may they hear it and see the need to respond in faith!

As you read Psalm 122 today, pray also for the peace of God’s people, His house.

Seeking the good of the church with you,  
C.

> **Psalm 122**  
> *A song of ascents. Of David.*
> 
> 1 I rejoiced with those who said to me,  
> “Let us go to the house of the LORD.”
> 
> 2 Our feet are standing  
> in your gates, O Jerusalem.
> 
> 3 Jerusalem is built like a city  
> that is closely compacted together.
> 
> 4 That is where the tribes go up,  
> the tribes of the LORD,  
> to praise the name of the LORD  
> according to the statute given to Israel.
> 
> 5 There the thrones for judgment stand,  
> the thrones of the house of David.
> 
> 6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem:  
> “May those who love you be secure.
> 
> 7 May there be peace within your walls  
> and security within your citadels.”
> 
> 8 For the sake of my brothers and friends,  
> I will say, “Peace be within you.”
> 
> 9 For the sake of the house of the LORD our God,  
> I will seek your prosperity.
