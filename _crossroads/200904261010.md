# Welcome, Baby Ha Yul!

Ha Yul is born! H——and his wife L——had the baby girl at 5:15pm, Sunday, April 26 (Chinese time). She was 9 lbs. He said that both are doing well.

Her name means, “The Word of God is Flowing Like a River.” We thank our Father that this family is growing! He is blessing the nations through them.

Pray for them! We love you, H——!
