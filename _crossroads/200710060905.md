# Church Meeting This Sunday (10/7)

Church,

We will meet again in the basement of B—— and E——’s apartment building. Meet in front of UTA at 5pm so that you can be brought in.

It was a good place for us to meet, with room for meeting and also eating, and an enclosed play area for children! It is a semi-public place for those who are new who would like to join us.

Ask God that He would give us a love for our neighbors and a zeal for His honor. We looked at Scripture last week from the Book of Numbers, where the people were in constant need of someone to step in between them and God, to intercede (to plead with God for the people) and intervene (to plead with the people for God). Christ has finally stood in the breach for us and has freed us to minister in the same way. Let us serve others for His glory.

Praying for you,
C.
