# Psalms 123

Family,

There is a good-bye pot-luck dinner for D—— and M—— this Thursday, April 6th, at 7pm. C—— is hosting the dinner, with the International BSU staff, and Crossroads is invited. Please RSVP to her if you can come, and notify her what you can bring (so that way we don’t have all salads or desserts). You can also bring your favorite D—— and M—— story (or, your most embarrassing D—— story :) ).

Pray today for: M—— and also M——, as she passes the “torch” to him for the International BSU. M—— is doing the best she can to transfer important relationships and administrative details to him today and this week. This ministry is also a vital part of our church’s ministry.

Keep serving the Lord while waiting for His mercy and help; He is Sovereign. Meditate on Psalms 123.

C.

> **Psalms 123**  
> *A song of ascents.*
> 
> 1 I lift up my eyes to you,  
> to you whose throne is in heaven.
> 
> 2 As the eyes of slaves look to the hand of their master,  
> as the eyes of a maid look to the hand of her mistress,  
> so our eyes look to the LORD our God,  
> till he shows us his mercy.
> 
> 3 Have mercy on us, O LORD, have mercy on us,  
> for we have endured much contempt.
> 
> 4 We have endured much ridicule from the proud,  
> much contempt from the arrogant.
