# Birth Announcement

A forward from D—— and M——, a family we love who had been members of Crossroads:

> After months of anticipation, our daughter Noel Tawnee was born on the morning of Dec 30, 2008. She weighed 8 lbs and was 22 inches long. She has a full set of beautiful dark hair. She loves to be held and talked to. She is such a blessing. We want to thank you all for praying for us. God is good and He answered our prayers. I had a really smooth delivery and Noel is healthy and beautiful. Her pictures are on the hospital website. Thanks again for your prayers and support. May you have a wonderful new year and God bless you!
