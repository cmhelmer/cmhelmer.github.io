# Missions and Membership Celebration

Crossroads,

This Sunday (8/16) we will celebrate what God has done this summer through missions and what he is now doing at Crossroads. We’ll hear from those that the church sent out for the summer and we’ll also hear testimonies from those who want to join the church.

Please bring an item for the potluck dinner. All are welcome!

Looking forward to meeting with you all!  
C.
