# Emergency Request for Prayer

To those whom are praying,

Please pray with us now. The first week of camp in New York is about to begin at 11am today. Youth from around the area will come to encounter the good news for the first time or take another step in their walk with God. K—— and I will serve as Camp Counselors / Missionaries.

There is an emergency. This morning the camp director seriously injured his foot and is on his way to the hospital. He also wounded his knee Saturday. We have had a number of challenges to get camp rolling for the summer but we expect God has good things in store. K—— and I have been here during the past week helping get the camp ready and ministering here. This camp and its directors are very close to our hearts. Please pray for the director and for this week’s camp!

Thank you!  
C.
