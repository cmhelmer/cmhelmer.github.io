# Crossroads Preaching Schedule

Men,

I was given a list of “Preachers of the Day” by D—— before he left. Yesterday was the first Sunday meeting, and I preached on Ephesians 3:1-13 (where D—— left off). I will also be “facilitating” the next four services. On the week you are scheduled to preach, if you are able, please let M—— or I know what you will be preaching on, so songs and Scripture readings can be selected (you’re welcome to select these also). You don’t have to continue in Ephesians. Let me know if there are any problems! Thanks for your service; we have been given a gift to preach the gospel.

Here is the schedule:  
Sunday, August 28: H——  
Sunday, September 4: J——  
Sunday, September 11: H——  
Sunday, September 18: J——

Thanks again!  
C.
