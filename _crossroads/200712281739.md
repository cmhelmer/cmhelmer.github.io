# Are you in town? A New Year’s Day event

Hello Church!

Congratulations, M—— and J——! Congratulations, H—— and L——! We love you very much!

If you are in town for New Year’s Day on Tuesday, we will have a little church get-together. New friends that have been attending church recently, B—— and K——, invited us to their home for lunch.

K—— and I hope you’ll join us there. Contact info is below. You can also call us if you have any questions.

Come 1/1/2008 at 1pm. Main dish will be provided. Please bring a side dish to share!

Your brother,  
C.
