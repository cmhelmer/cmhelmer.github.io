# “Secrets of Language Learning” by Nida

On a poster in a United Mission to Nepal classroom in Kathmandu, “Secrets of Language Learning,” from *Learning a Foreign Language* by Eugene Nida (Bible translator):

> 1. Language must be automatic, or it is practically useless.
> 
> 2. Only after one has learned to sit and listen can one profitably stand and speak.
> 
> 3. Three processes:
> - Drill and repetition
> - Thinking in the foreign language, and
> - Continued opportunities to use the language
> 
> 4. In general one must murder a language before mastering it, and part of the murdering process must begin at once.
