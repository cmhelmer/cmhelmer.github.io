  description:	"Into the North"
---

The North is a place both majestic and haunted. The road there is difficult. The believers feel alone and afraid. Over the weekend we encouraged them in love, prayer, and the Word.

One family was afraid to meet us in public. Another family wept while we met. Two people were sick and with little help. A young lady shared her new faith with her family. Another brother had a fire in his eyes for more. Some heard the Word in their mother-tongue for the first time.

No church has ever taken root here. But there are seeds.
