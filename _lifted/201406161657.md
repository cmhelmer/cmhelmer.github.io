From the boys:

> We like yeti stories. We liked when a yeti monster on the *Monsters, Inc.* movie said, “Welcome to the Himalayas!” We like to stare at the mountains with Daddy and look for yeti caves. We like when Daddy pretends to be a yeti for us. So we got this shirt for him. Happy Father’s Day!
