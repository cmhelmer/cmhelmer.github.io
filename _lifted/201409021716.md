# Nepali Folk Song?

Our family has been trying to learn traditional Nepali songs. One evening we were sitting around the table flipping through a Nepali hymn-book trying to sing what we could. We came to a contextualized version of a good ol’ folk song by Woody Guthrie. It was good for a laugh after a day of language learning. No doubt in another time an American missionary labored to bless the Nepali peoples with this translated song. Here it is for you in Devanagari script and translated back.

> <span lang="ne">यो देश येशूको देश, मेरो पनि यो देश  
> हिमालयदेखि तराईसम्म,  
> महाकालीदेखि मेचीसम्म  
> तपाईँ र मेरो यो देश</span>
> 
> This land is Jesus’ land, this land is my land  
> From the Himalayas to the Terai grassland,  
> From the Mahakali to the Mechi river,  
> This land is made for you and me.
