# Where Is My Concern?

I've been angry when some provision here fails. Then I spend more time over what’s lost. Lost stuff over lost people. Where is my concern for what matters more? Here is a prophetic word I heard today:

> God said to Jonah, “Are you really so very angry about the little plant?” And he said, “I am as angry as I could possibly be!” The LORD said, “You were upset about this little plant, something for which you have not worked nor did you do anything to make it grow. It grew up overnight and died the next day. Should I not be even more concerned about Nineveh, this enormous city? There are more than one hundred twenty thousand people in it who do not know right from wrong, as well as many animals!”

> —Jonah 4:9–11 (NET)
