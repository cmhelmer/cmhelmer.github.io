This picture is either of a piece of wet spaghetti thrown the other day against the wall (when mom and dad stepped out of the kitchen) or the start of the road up to our hill town. C——’s favorite part is the loop-the-loop, where the road spirals over itself! This map doesn’t show elevation, but the switchbacks don’t lie. The town is almost a mile up and it takes 10 miles of climbing road to get there. At least the kids don’t get sick anymore!
