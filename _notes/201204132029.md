# “Such a struggle… such a saint”

> “How can the regenerate *Paul* — man of God that he is, and author of Romans 6 and 8 — be experiencing such a *struggle* with sin as we see in Romans 7?”
> 
> Packer gently leaned over the table, looked me in the eye, and said, “Young man, Paul wasn’t struggling with sin because he was such a sinner. Paul was *struggling* because he was such a saint.”
