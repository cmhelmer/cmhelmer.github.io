# Ways I’ve Studied the Biblical Languages on the Field

If you’re curious about how I’ve studied the biblical languages while on the field, I’ve used:

- [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) software for vocabulary review
- [Daily Dose of Greek](http://dailydoseofgreek.com) videos by Dr. Rob Plummer (a gifted teacher and former missionary)
- [Accordance](https://www.accordancebible.com) software for in-depth study of biblical languages
- [Logos](https://www.logos.com) software, along with [Translator’s Workplace](https://www.sil.org/resources/publications/tw), for biblical commentaries and other resources

The internet was not always so reliable in South Asia and in our small town, but has now become good enough to stream short videos and download large software packages (sometimes overnight).

I prefer digital materials for research but not reading. My use of biblical languages is for research. Besides, books are so heavy (and costly) to transport overseas. I can carry a digital library with me as a I travel.
