# Lamppost in a Snowy Wood

![Illustration by Pauline Baynes](https://cmhelmer.com/media/201304050736_1.jpg)

> It will not go out of my mind that if we pass this post and lantern, either we shall find strange adventures or else some great changes of our fortunes.

> ―Lucy Pevensie in C. S. Lewis’s *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe*

[This is a great moment in literature. A scene of common elements — a lamppost in a snowy wood — becomes a threshold to an “other” place. Even now. —C.M.H.]
