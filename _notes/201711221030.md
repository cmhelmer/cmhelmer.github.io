# Non-technical Accessibility Tips for UI Design

Notes from “[Advocating for Accessible UI Design](https://css-tricks.com/advocating-for-accessible-ui-design/)” by Lara Schenck on *CSS-Tricks*.

Accessibility is not just the responsibility of web developers. Accessibility begins with design decisions. Share non-technical tips for UI design to everyone on the team so they make more accessible design choices in future:

1. Easy on the animations.
2. Make sure background and text colors have enough contrast.
3. Be very careful when overlaying text on images, or don’t.
4. Double-check the readability of font weights and sizes.
5. Indicate external links.
6. Differentiate between action-oriented social media links vs. profile links.
7. Don’t rely 100% on icons and colors to communicate.
8. Consider what the design would look like without interactivity.
