> Let me tell you a story  
it’s no ordinary tale  
no it is the ordinary  
from which every other story hails
> 
> it’s the story of God  
it’s the story of history  
and I’m not the author  
no, the Author is a glorious mystery
> 
> see long before He would put  
His pen to the paper  
long before there was time  
or before there was matter
> 
> He was there, all alone  
Father Son Holy Sprit  
1 God in 3 persons  
everlasting in existence
> 
> completely satisfied  
needing absolutely nothing  
He was happy in Himself  
and His joy was overflowing
> 
> the Son in the arms  
of His holy righteous Father  
the Spirit overshadowing  
all glorifying one another
> 
> so why would this God  
even bother to create  
the fountain of all happiness  
can you improve upon this state?
> 
> well the joy within Himself  
welling up at such capacity  
was so full it must be shared  
with a glorious society
> 
> so the mighty Author, quill in hand,  
to share His infinite mind,  
His love His joy, sat down to write  
His “once upon a time”
> 
> in the beginning God created  
the Heavens and the Earth  
He made all things to reflect  
His beauty and His worth
> 
> mountains rivers oceans trees  
all gladly testifying  
endless stars and galaxies  
declare His glory shining
> 
> He made it all and it was good  
and to culminate His work  
He fashioned man  
and breathed to life  
His special ball of dirt
> 
> man came to life with blinking eyes  
& was welcomed by God’s face  
they walked with Him every day and night  
there was peace and no such thing as shame
> 
> God said  
be fruitful, fill the earth  
and eat from any tree  
except for this one  
cause if you do you’ll surely fall from Me
> 
> now why do this? and give this choice?  
because He is writing a Story  
and He’s about to show to whole world  
The fullness of His glory
> 
> conflict enters  
early on in the script  
with a snake in the garden  
doing was he does best running his lip
> 
> flashback to when  
this evil was created  
he was an angel of heaven  
who fell when his head got inflated
> 
> banished from God  
and from His endless mercy  
he came down to earth  
to tempt us with the unworthy
> 
> so there in the garden  
on an ordinary day  
he came to the woman and said  
did God really say?
> 
> that you should not eat  
from every tree in the garden?  
He must not want your happiness  
or you would have total freedom
> 
> so pridefully they listened  
and sinfully they took  
and scorned their creator  
and they ate the forbidden fruit
> 
> injustice. this, my friends  
this is injustice  
that God should be seen &  
then treated as a nothing
> 
> that man should completely forfeit his joy  
and dig for fleeting pleasures  
in the gutters of this world
> 
> fallen now is all mankind  
and sure to face His judgement  
a world of pain, of toil and strain  
and hell forever after
> 
> but God would make a promise to  
preserve Himself a people  
and through the brokenness of man  
o could there shine a hero?
> 
> the plot line continues  
some character development  
all supporting actors  
all fantastic as embellishment
> 
> Noah found great favor  
in God’s holy sight  
and when God sent the floods  
He mercifully preserved his life
> 
> we come to Abraham  
and God made him a covenant  
He said “I will bless you  
and make your offspring abundant”
> 
> to Isaac and to Jacob  
God would come and do the same  
and though many dangers  
came to threaten His perfect plan
> 
> the story would go on  
with the Author’s full control  
and He would lead His people  
everywhere that they should go
> 
> flash forward now 400 years  
in Egypt there’s a pharaoh  
who doesn’t like God’s people  
growing numerous in freedom
> 
> so he made them slaves  
but God came down and chose His servant Moses  
a burning bush… a call to go  
His presence was His promise
> 
> go and tell that pharaoh now to  
let my people go  
so they can freely worship Me  
in the place that I will show
> 
> plagues.  numerous  
God would show that He is the I AM  
that pharaoh’ rule is like a pawn  
in His glorious hand
> 
> the waters part. the millions leave  
to follow their great Savior  
He guided them provided for them  
though they were so ungrateful
> 
> at Sinai God gave the law  
so perfect and so pure  
His people soon discovered  
they could not obey these rules
> 
> they tried they failed  
they tried they failed  
compelled to live in sin  
they’d bow to worship idols  
then they’d bow to God again
> 
> they said to God “give us a king”  
and that will make things better  
God, their rightful king, assured them  
this would be a fetter
> 
> they insisted, God relented  
gave to them their kings  
some were good, led them to Him  
some brought idolatry
> 
> God sent his prophets  
“turn back to God”  
sometimes the people listened  
but mostly they just gave a nod  
cause they all wanted to be Him
> 
> “God will not wink at your sin”  
the prophets would all say  
the people rose to eat and drink  
and left to go and play
> 
> God finally seemed to have enough  
and brought a blaring quiet  
the prophets ceased, the people waited  
400 years of silence
> 
> enter our protagonist  
mostly unannounced  
the plot is quickly rising now
> 
> who is this guy?  
nobody really knows  
He meek…..He’s humble  
unordinary hero
> 
> but the craziest thing  
about this character is well  
unlike the other characters  
this is the Author himself
> 
> His name was Jesus  
He was born of a virgin  
fully God He was perfect  
fully man He was learnin’
> 
> different from all the others  
but tempted just the same  
in every single way we are  
without a single sin
> 
> He made the lame to jump  
He caused the blind to see  
and unlike the religious leaders  
had some real authority
> 
> cause He came from high  
and He came to redeem  
not to be served but to serve  
His haters and enemies
> 
> He loved, He gave  
showed us the heart of the Author  
claimed no glory for Himself  
cause He came from His Father
> 
> and we hated Him for it  
cause we wanted to be God  
despised and rejected  
we esteemed Him not
> 
> conflict escalating now  
it’s starts with a betrayal  
Judas whores his eternal Lord  
for 30 pieces of silver
> 
> a final meal a prayer and then  
they head into the garden  
where Jesus sweat with drops of blood  
preparing for our pardon
> 
> The soldiers took the Lord away  
and led him to a trail  
“are you the Son of God?” they say  
I AM there’s no denying
> 
> Except of course for His disciples  
who left their Lord in fear  
Jesus looked up to the sky  
He was all alone from here
> 
> they led Him to the Pretorian  
and then began to beat Him  
“who hit you?” they would shout and say  
“oh Father please forgive them”
> 
> they made His back a bloody mess  
they whipped Him till he lost his breath  
they threw the cross upon His wounds  
the weight of sin 300 pounds
> 
> the great eternal Lord of all  
the Author of all things  
now like a lamb unto the slaughter  
would this be His defeat?
> 
> they nailed Him to the rugged cross  
they shouted out “where is Your God?”  
He said “have You forsaken me?”  
He takes a breath, His final three:
> 
> “It is finished”  the Savior’s cry  
and then He bowed His head  
the Author of life the Lord of all  
the Son of God is dead
> 
> they laid His body in a tomb  
then everything was quiet  
as God’s people find themselves again  
in everlasting silence
> 
> 2 days pass
> 
> on the second morning after Jesus died  
Mary went to the tomb to take a look inside
> 
> and when she arrived she was  
met by an angel  
she fell to the ground but he said  
there’s no danger
> 
> this Jesus, Jesus  
is He the one that you seek?  
Mary He is not here  
He is risen indeed!
> 
> Climax, its true  
every good story has one  
the part where you feel  
a slight shift of momentum
> 
> Mary sprints to go  
tell the disciples  
the Lord, He’s alive!  
He’s alive like he promised
> 
> Peter and john go  
and see for themselves  
but there’s nothing there  
they said “perhaps He truly lives?”
> 
> then Jesus’ words  
came flashing to mind  
they will kill the Son of man  
but after three days He will rise
> 
> momentum is surely building now  
the enemy is limpin’  
Jesus finds the 12 and then  
He gives to them the mission
> 
> all authority is mine  
all in Heaven and on Earth  
go and tell them I’m alive  
go and tell the whole wide world
> 
> and don’t get slack  
I’m coming back
> 
> Acts now the church is born  
the Holy Spirit given  
the news of Jesus  
like the most contagious sickness spreadin’
> 
> thousands saved. A mighty wind  
is blowing through the region  
the promise God gave to Abraham  
we’re finally starting to see it
> 
> Repentance and forgiveness preached  
All in the name of Jesus  
Sinners and saints alike proclaim  
Our God has come to save us!
> 
> the Gentiles hear the story and  
the news is blowing up  
the plan is working, the gospel spreading  
from Asia to Africa
> 
> martyrs laying down their lives  
cause they know this story’s true  
it’s a story like no other  
it’s a movement you cannot undo
> 
> Constantine tried to slow it down  
and turn it into steeples  
but an angry monk from Germany  
wrote some holy gospel thesis
> 
> it’s spread like fire, then it came  
to America by sail  
and here we are the twenty-first century  
the gospel cannot fail
> 
> It’s the greatest story  
that’s ever been told  
by the greatest Author the world has ever known
> 
> but there is some still left to go  
yes there is some still left to go
> 
> see GO was the command  
to every tribe and nation  
and carry this great story to  
this dying generation
> 
> cause when this gospel finally spreads  
across the whole of earth  
we’re gonna hear a trumpet sound  
and Jesus will return
> 
> Heaven will be opened  
and a white horse shall appear  
and the One who sits upon it  
all His enemies shall fear
> 
> His eyes will be like fire  
and His purpose will be glory  
justice for all evil  
life for all who love this story
> 
> He’ll come to judge the quick, the dead  
and all who’ve trod this world….every  
knee will bow  
and tongue confess that  
Jesus Christ is Lord
> 
> death and hades He will throw  
into the Lake of Fire  
and Satan too that serpent foe  
that coward that old liar
> 
> the church will rise  
surround the throne  
and clothed in glory His  
with every nation tribe and tongue  
we will worship Him
> 
> singing Worthy Worthy  
is the Lamb  
The Lamb who has been slain  
blessings honor glory and power  
forever to His name
> 
> and for ages and ages  
we will sing  
the praises of  
our God and King
> 
> it’s the greatest story  
that ever been told  
by the greatest Author  
the world has known
> 
> yeah the bad guys lose  
the good guys win  
Jesus is Lord of all  
The End.
