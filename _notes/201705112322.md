# “Pursuit of truth had… soured their affections one for another”

The Ephesian believers tested those who call themselves apostles. They were theologically fierce, engaged in missions, yet unloving. And that’s deadly.

> What we see in the church at Ephesus, therefore, was how their desire for orthodoxy and the exclusion of error had created a climate of suspicion and mistrust in which brotherly love could no longer flourish. Their eager pursuit of truth had to some degree soured their affections one for another. It’s one thing not to “bear with those who are evil” (Rev. 2:2), but it’s another thing altogether when that intolerance carries over to your relationship with other Christ-loving Christians!
