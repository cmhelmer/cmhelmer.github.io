# Energize Your Team: “At the end of the day, everyone is a volunteer”

Highlights of [Michael Hyatt, “6 Ways to Energize Your Team.”](https://michaelhyatt.com/energize-your-team/)

> As a leader, you have an effect on people. When you leave the room, people either feel taller or smaller. This is an almost super-hero power, but, unfortunately, leaders are often unconscious of it…
> 
> [A]t the end of the day, *everyone is a volunteer*. People will only go so far in the performance of a duty. If you want their very best, you have to have their hearts. You can’t demand this or even buy it with a paycheck. You have to earn it.
> 
> In my experience, there are six ways to do this:
> 
> 1. Assume others are smart and working hard.
> 2. Listen intently and ask thoughtful questions.
> 3. Acknowledge the sacrifices others have made on your behalf.
> 4. Express gratitude for their effort and their results.
> 5. Remind them why their work is so important.
> 6. Put slack in the system.
> 
> … [C]onsider, *How do I want people to feel when the meeting is over?* Begin with the end in mind.
