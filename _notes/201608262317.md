# “Facing a Task Unfinished” Hymn Project

![Facing a Task Unfinished](https://cmhelmer.com/media/201608262317_1.jpg)

Have you heard the latest album from modern hymn-writers, Keith and Kristyn Getty, “Facing a Task Unfinished”? A friend said, tongue-in-cheek, that hymns about missions are a paradox. My family has it on repeat right now. It’s timely for us. Go listen for yourself.
