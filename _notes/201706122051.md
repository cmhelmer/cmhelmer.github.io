# PDFs as Images

![](https://cmhelmer.com/media/201706122051_1.pdf)

PDFs are vector documents but are also valid images sources [in modern browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_browsers#Image_format_support).

I had been looking for a solution to display PDFs in an HTML page, rather than just provide a link to view or download it separately. Browsers used plugins in the past, and there are some good JavaScript solutions to display multi-page PDFs like [Mozilla’s pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/). But my need at the time was simple. I wanted a visual of the PDF but I didn’t want to convert the PDF to a destructive image format. I was pleased to learn that I could make a PDF file the `src` of an `<img>` tag in HTML.

**Limitations:** Only the first page of a PDF will be displayed inline. This restriction is [according to the specs](https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/semantics-embedded-content.html#the-img-element). And you cannot point to a specific page of a multi-page PDF document like you can with an anchor link (ex. `<a href="....pdf#page=2>`).

So this technique is good for one-page PDFs or to display the first page of a multi-page PDF as a preview image, linked to the full document. If you use a Markdown editor like Ulysses, know that you can similarly use a PDF as an image.
