# The Books of “When I Give A Book”

I enjoyed Helena Sorensen’s *Shiloh Series*. She recently wrote [an article about giving books](https://storywarren.com/when-i-give-a-book/) and what she’s really giving with the gift of a book.

She may not have had in mind a book checklist but I’ve reduced it to that! Her article was it’s own gift of reading recommendations. And I’m looking for recommendations for those “hours spent pleasantly… by the fire, during a blizzard, at the beach, curled in bed… [h]ours of laughing or dreaming or catching your breath….”
