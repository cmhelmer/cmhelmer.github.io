# The Books of “When I Give A Book”

I’ve enjoyed Helena Sorensen’s books. She wrote up [a nice piece about giving books](https://storywarren.com/when-i-give-a-book/) and what else she’s giving in the gift of a book.

She wrote more than a book checklist but I’ve reduced it to that! Her article was it’s own gift of book recommendations. And I’m looking for that when it’s time for “hours spent pleasantly… by the fire, during a blizzard, at the beach, curled in bed… [h]ours of laughing or dreaming or catching your breath….”
