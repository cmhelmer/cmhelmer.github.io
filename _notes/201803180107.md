# How I’ve Used the Biblical Languages on the Field

This is a running list of practical ways I’ve used Greek and Hebrew in missions work. This isn’t a list of how I wish to use the languages, but just an honest look at how I have.

1. I regularly check Greek when I work with Bible translation teams. This happens when there’s a question and discussion about a key term, or when reviewing their work for a consultant check (the final stage of approval by an expert).
2. I help translation teams to access biblical resources and I occasionally read Greek for them in commentaries.
3. I sometimes check Greek when teaching a Bible book to pastors. Last fall I taught Titus and this spring, Colossians. This kind of use is for my own benefit and to prepare for the confusion that comes when teaching verse by verse to speakers of another language and with their Bible.
4. When I teach weekly at church, I read multiple English versions as one way to meditate and study. If there’s a verse with significant differences between the versions, that’s a signal to check the biblical languages.
5. I use software entirely for biblical languages and resources, not hard copies (Accordance for languages, Logos for commentaries and other references).
6. I haven’t used Hebrew (yet).
7. I don’t know Aramaic.
