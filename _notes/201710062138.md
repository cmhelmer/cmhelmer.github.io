# HTML Reversed Ordered List

Iâ€™ve learned that you can reverse the sequence of numbers in an HTML ordered list (`<ol>`) with the HTML5 attribute, `reversed`. As in:

``` html
<ol reversed>
	<li>French hens</li>
	<li>Turtledoves</li>
	<li>Partridge in a pear tree</li>
</ol>
```

Which gives:

<div class="output">
<ol reversed>
	<li>French hens</li>
	<li>Turtledoves</li>
	<li>Partridge in a pear tree</li>
</ol>
</div>

There is also the attribute `start` to specify the start value, useful to resume the numbering of a list after it is interrupted by another block element.
