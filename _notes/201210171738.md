# “From love of the thing he tells, to love of the telling”

> I also have had to recover from that. It was all a snare. Ink and catgut and paint were necessary down there, but they are also dangerous stimulants. Every poet and musician and artist, but for Grace, is drawn away from love of the thing he tells, to love of the telling till, down in Deep Hell, they cannot be interested in God at all but only in what they say about Him. For it doesn’t stop at being interested in paint, you know. They sink lower — become interested in their own personalities and then in nothing but their own reputations.
> 
> —C. S. Lewis, *The Great Divorce* (78–79)

[These words often come to mind: “drawn away from love of the thing he tells, to love of the telling….” I receive it as correction and needed “Grace.” —C.M.H.]
