# “How to Write for the Web”: Summary

Summary of [Dudley Storey, “How to Write for the Web: Murder Your Darlings.”](http://demosthenes.info/blog/531/How-To-Write-For-The-Web)

Cull cleverness from written sentences. Most visitors read less than 20% of web page content. Users scan web page text for useful or interesting information.

- Write concisely.
- Have an effective print stylesheet.
- Write backwards.
- Use “news style” when writing, dividing your page content into “chunks."
- Record each of these “chunks” in a Content Management System (CMS).
- Try to keep 60–70 characters per line.
- Use headings and subheadings.
- Insert ordered and unordered lists.
- Highlight key words and concepts.
- Link to relevant resources.
- Don’t use directional writing, such as, “see the map to the left.”
- Make sure your spelling and grammar are correct.
- Target your sentences to the reader's literacy level.
- Define acronyms by using the <abbr> tag or use them sparingly.
- Use images to retain interest.
- Avoid “marketing-speak.”
- Use mixed case, not UPPERCASE for more than a few words on a page.
- Write as if you have only six exclamation points to use in your entire life.
- Place a “call to action” in the text.
- Keep the text on the page updated and include an indication of when the page was last changed.
