# Jesus Film in Nepali (and Related Films)

The “Jesus” film is dubbed in Nepali and available for download at [https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/jesus.html/nepali.html](https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/jesus.html/nepali.html).

Also available in Nepali are versions of “Jesus” for children, “[The Story of Jesus for Children](https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/jfp-interests-student-resources.html/the-story-of-jesus-for-children/nepali.html),” and women, “[Magdalena](https://www.jesusfilm.org/watch/magdalena.html/magdalena-director-cut/nepali.html).”

I must mention that the word “film” in “Jesus Film” cannot be pronounced here. It has a cluster of consonants that is too foreign for Nepal and South Asia. So it gets said “flim.”
