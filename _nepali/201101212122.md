# Nepali Bibles Online

This page is not an exhaustive list of Nepali Bible translations, nor online Nepali resources which are Christian. It is a short list of Bible texts or Bible audio in Nepali which are available online and which I have used.

## Text

- [**Nepali New Revised (NRV) and Simple Nepali (SN) Versions**](http://www.nepalbiblesociety.org)  
	Source: Nepal Bible Society. Available by request or in Nepali Christian bookstores in [SWORD format](http://www.crosswire.org). For help using these texts on macOS and iOS, see [[201303141524]].  
	  
	[**YouVersion**](https://www.bible.com/languages/nep) also has the NBS NRV and SN through the Bible.com website for online reading and companion app on mobile phones for offline downloading.

- [**Easy-to-Read Version (ERV) Nepali Bible**](https://www.bibleleague.org/bible-downloads/)  
	Source: Bible League International. PDF downloads for Old Testament and New Testament.  
	  
	The ERV is translated by World Bible Translation Center, which uses an accelerated translation process. This process has resulted in problematic translations in other languages. For another version in easy language, consider Nepal Bible Society’s Simple Nepali translation.

- **<s>IBS-STL Nepali Bible</s>**  
	Source: Biblica (formerly International Bible Society and Send the Light). [No longer available.]

## Audio

- [**Nepali New Revised Version New Testament Audio Drama**](http://listen.bible.is/NEPNRV/Matt/1/D)  
	Source: Faith Comes By Hearing. Available: online listening or MP3 download, through the Bible.is website and companion app for mobile phones.

- [**Nepali Bible Story Set**](https://orality.imb.org/resources/?id=227)  
	Source: IMB Orality Strategies. MP3 downloads.  
	  
	Nepali Bible Story Set is a basic set of 28 Old and New Testament stories and a “Creation to Church” overview story. It has a PDF transcript in Nepali with English translation, and PDF memory aids for each story with Nepali-style illustrations, written outlines and questions. It’s geared toward western Nepal and Hindu background listeners, but simple enough for all. It’s also great Nepali language learning.
