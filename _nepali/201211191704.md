# Nepali Dictionaries Online

Two of the most useful and recommended Nepali dictionaries in print are also available online:

- [*A Practical Dictionary of Modern Nepali* by Ruth Laila Schmidt](http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/schmidt/)
- [*A Comparative and Etymological Dictionary of the Nepali Language* by R. L. Turner](http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/turner/)

The first dictionary (Schmidt) is up-to-date and offers words in context, variants and romanized transliteration. The second (Turner) is much older but helpful for understanding difficult words.
