Watch this video of New Testament Professor, Eckhard Schnabel, explain Acts. Pound the table in excitement like Glen did when he saw it. It affirms our approach to missions. Doesn’t it?

I found [the video on Steve Addison’s church planting movements blog](http://www.movements.net/2016/06/23/why-study-acts-eckhardt-schnabel.html). He found it affirming too, I take it.

I’m not big on “church planting movements” teaching like Steve is. Actually, I try to emphasize the teaching as much (or as little) as the apostles did. Yet Steve Addison is devoted to the apostles’ teaching, too. I’m glad for that.
