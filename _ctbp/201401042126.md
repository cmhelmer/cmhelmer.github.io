# Reading The Multilingual God

I just read *The Multilingual God* by Steve Fortosis. It's a compendium of Bible translation fascinations, a popular-level work for those interested in the exotic experiences of translators and their rewards.

I benefitted most from the final chapters which discussed hard sayings in the Bible (different for each culture!), the need for humor when translating, and the implications of divine inspiration on Bible translation philosophy.

This book can help you appreciate the difficulties of the task but donâ€™t let fascination with it distance you from personal, prayerful involvement. If you learn anything from a work like this it is that problems arise when translators work alone and solutions arise when we involve others.
