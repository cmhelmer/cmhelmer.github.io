# “Missionaries Need Local Churches, Too.”

A missions leader asked me where I was meaningfully involved in a church on the field. Only in the last year of service abroad could I answer that question, and it’s been a good year because of it.

Let’s spur each other on to participation and accountability in a local church. Here’s a timely article I pass on to you, “Missionaries Need Local Churches, Too”:

> [M]issionary teams must hold to a biblically robust understanding of the local church. They must obey the biblical imperatives for Christians to be meaningfully involved in local churches — they aren’t exempt simply because of their roles as missionaries.

> We — all believers, including missionaries — want to be “members of one another” and understand that we can only plant healthy churches when we submit to a church ourselves.
