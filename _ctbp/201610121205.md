# “A Life Transformed by God’s Word”: John Piper on William Tyndale

On October 6, 1536, William Tyndale was executed for translating  the Bible from the original languages into modern English. He was accused of “always singing a single note”: God’s Word in the vernacular. For that he was exiled, betrayed, strangled and burned. Many of Tyndale’s words and phrases remain in use today, 480 years later. This is the legacy of your English Bible.

I was [reminded of Tyndale this week](http://www.timothypauljones.com/church-history-how-william-tyndale-changed-the-world/). So I remembered a message I heard John Piper give about him when I was preparing to go abroad for the sake of God’s Word. Piper presented Tyndale’s life as worthy of imitation, in taking seriously the call to study God’s Word and to translate it. He challenged thousands of young adults to be involved in Bible translation. I share with you what was challenging and confirming to me.
