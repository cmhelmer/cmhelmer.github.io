# Ethnologue, 20th Edition

The [20th edition of the *Ethnologue* was released](https://www.ethnologue.com/ethnoblog/gary-simons/welcome-20th-edition) on the occasion of International Mother Language Day.

The *Ethnologue* has been documenting the world’s languages since 1951. This edition lists 7,099 living languages worldwide. Eleven languages that were listed as living in the previous edition were dropped and 13 are newly listed as living.

Also, the Ethnologue now adds new data for many languages: the written autonym (“self name”) that the speakers of the language give to the language itself; country-level international conventions to which the country is signatory and which affirm the language and culture rights of indigenous and minority peoples; and any revitalization efforts in language development.
