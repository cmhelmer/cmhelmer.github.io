# A Few Questions from John Piper about Missions, Orality, and the Bible

Have you read this short article by John Piper, “[Missions, Orality, and the Bible: Thoughts on Pre-, Less-, and Post-literate Cultures](http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/missions-orality-and-the-bible)”? He puts the orality movement into perspective then characteristically challenges its underlying assumptions and encourages immediacy of the Scriptures. Piper published the article near nine years ago but it should still add to the current discussion.

Whether you aspire to serve across culture and language or to preach the Word in your own, consider what responsibility you have to bring the written Word to unreached oral learners. And then consider what responsibility you have to bring oral learners to the written Word.
