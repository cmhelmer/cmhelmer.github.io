# Theology and Missiology: Two Brothers Who Don’t Talk

[Andy McTazi recast the parable of the Prodigal Son](http://www.towinsome.com/two-brothers/) for all self-respecting missionaries and theologians. I cheer when I hear someone bring together theology and missiology like this:

> There are two brothers who don’t talk to each other very much. Let’s call the older brother Theology, and the younger brother… Missiology.

> … It’s not so much that they are constantly arguing; more that they move in different circles and pretend each other don’t exist.

> The younger is adventurous.… The older… is conservative.… The father loves both [and] invites both to his parties.…

> *Both brothers* have their sins. Both also have their gift. But they need each other. Oh for churches and movements that are strong in both!
