# “Kingdom Story” Update

I updated “The Kingdom Story,” our Creation to Christ panorama, based on further study, usage and feedback. A volunteer team and I used it widely this month in village homes, churches, and at a youth leaders conference, so I had reason to record changes. The story is more internally consistent (as a stand-alone story) and is now under 500 words.

### Changes:
- Added “In the beginning” to mirror other time references in the middle and end of the story.
- Changed instances of “made” to “created” to connect creation with new creation, however loosely. This change may not translate.
- God’s promise (3rd paragraph) is now: “He promised to bless all peoples in one of their descendants” (from Gal. 3:8 and Gen. 12). The promise needs to summarize the covenants! I see Abraham’s and David’s covenant in this paragraph.
- Added repentance “turn from sin and turn to God” to Jesus’ central kingdom announcement at story’s apex (Mark 1:15).
- Added “up” to ascension. Such a small word barely conveys the lordship of Jesus. The ascension is a regular part of NT gospel preaching.
- What word should we use for “baptize”? In past tellings, it’s been transliterated as is, or translated as “wash in water” or “immerse in water”. Now it’s a stronger phrase, “bury in water and raise up” to align with the picture of Jesus’ burial and resurrection in the story (see Rom. 6:4).
- Concerning the church (6th paragraph), “faith… love… hope…” is now prominent, as the pattern of teaching of some of the epistles (see Col. 1:4–5, 1 Thess. 1:3 for starters).
- Also added the word “church” itself with the phrase, “meeting together as churches”. As for it’s placement in the statement about “love,” see Heb. 10:25, 1 Cor. 13 with 14, Eph. 5, Col. 3. 
- Added reference to the Lord’s Supper as “eat together to remember Jesus”. It surely needs its own story, like many of these points, but the topic is as clear here as it is in the Acts phrase, “the breaking of bread”.
- Added “in King Jesus” to final paragraph.
