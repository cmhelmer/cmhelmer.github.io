# “The Whole Story of the Bible in 16 Verses” by Chris Bruno

[*The Whole Story of the Bible in 16 Verses* by Chris Bruno](https://www.crossway.org/books/the-whole-story-of-the-bible-in-16-verses-tpb/) is a book about the Bible to help you see the forest *and* the trees.

It caught my attention because it’s cut from the same cloth as [[201307242209 The Kingdom Story]]. Below is Bruno’s Bible summary and the individual verses he studies in the book. There’s a well-designed study guide and memory verse cards [at the publisher's site](https://www.crossway.org/books/the-whole-story-of-the-bible-in-16-verses-tpb/).

## The Story

> God created a kingdom, and he is the King, but he made human beings to represent him in that kingdom. Adam and Eve rejected this call, which led to sin and death. But God promised to defeat the Serpent through the seed of the woman, who is also the seed of Abraham. Through Abraham’s family, and specifically Judah’s royal seed, David, the covenant blessings would come to the world. Because all people were guilty and deserved death, the sacrifices of the Mosaic law revealed more clearly their need for a substitute — the suffering servant. Through the servant and the work of the Spirit, God would establish a new covenant and give lasting life to his people in the new heavens and new earth.

> Jesus is the One through whom all of these promises find fulfillment, first in his sacrificial death as a necessary and just payment for sin and then in his victorious resurrection and reign as King. This great story will find its culmination when the redeemed from every tribe, tongue, and nation gather in the new creation to live with God forever.
