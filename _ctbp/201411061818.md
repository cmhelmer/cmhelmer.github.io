# NT Dedication

At a New Testament dedication for a Himalayan language. This language is the second in the country to receive a NT and it’s this language’s only book. The first believer from this group is here and received the first book. This *babu*, or ‘father’ in the faith, was baptized in 1957 through the work of Christian medical workers.

I’m humbled and awed at this gift. Being readied to embrace a language and go deep.
