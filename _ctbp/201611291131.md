# Creation to Christmas: Big Picture Picture Books

At CTBP we know you’re looking for the perfect Christmas gift for the little ones in your life. Something simple yet significant. And you want our recommendation. Well…

Why not give them the Creation and Consummation of the cosmos in a picture book? What would better satisfy your niece or nephew than the biblical panorama of salvation history to read in one sitting? An epic present. Really.

The idea of the Bible as one epic story is catching on with authors, illustrators and publishers. Jesus started the idea (Luke 24:27, 44–49). Missionaries have taken to crafting “Creation to Christ” (C2C) stories to cross cultures. I tell it as [[201307242209 the Kingdom Story]]. And now there are picture books to give you more creative ways to convey the good news to your children. Make this year’s gift truly epic by doing it together: reading, believing and living out the story of the Bible.

Below are three winners and two honorable mentions in the category of… uh… big picture picture books.
