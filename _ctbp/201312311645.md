# “The first thing that happened in the life of the church was translation”

> The first thing that happened in the life of the church was *translation*. On the day of Pentecost, God’s powerful wind swept through Jesus’s followers, filling them, like the sails of a great oceangoing sailing ship, so that they could take God’s good news to the ends of the earth. And they found themselves speaking other languages, so that everyone in the crowd could understand. …
> 
> So, right from the start, they translated. Sometimes it happened, as at Pentecost, by the direct action of the holy spirit. Mostly, though it was through people eagerly turning the message into other languages.

> —N. T. Wright, preface to *The Kingdom New Testament*
