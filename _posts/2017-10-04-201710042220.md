Witness said a well spoken and calm man recited Bible verses about sin and repentance on a packed passenger train. Some people panicked, prised open the doors and went on to the tracks.

The train’s guard, “came over the public address system asking people what they were doing on the tracks and warning them that they could die if they touched a rail.”
