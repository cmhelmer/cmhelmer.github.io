DeYoung points to three signs in 1 John as evidence of salvation to counsel Christians: theological, moral, social. Are these not faith, hope and love?

On the surface, hope is the least clear of the three in his post. But the “moral” sign aligns with the treatment of hope in the epistles, that it is a persevering walk in holiness, not immorality (See, for example, Col. 3:1–5, 1 Thess. 4:1–8 and 1 Jn. 3:3).

DeYoung puts all three signs in terms of love (of God, his commands, and his people). That is the primary language of John. But that is also a sensible amplification of Jesus’ summary of the Law (Matt. 22:37–40). And it doesn’t contradict Paul’s three sign of faith, hope and love. He also emphasizes love (Gal. 5:6, 1 Cor. 13:13).
