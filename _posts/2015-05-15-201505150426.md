DeYoung points to three signs in 1 John as evidence of salvation to counsel Christians. Are these not faith, hope and love? Hope is the least clear of the three in his post on the surface. But the “moral” sign aligns with the view of hope in other epistles, that it is a persevering walk in holiness, not immorality.
