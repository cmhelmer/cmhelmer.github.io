Three titles caught my attention:

- [*Overturning Tables: Freeing Missions from the Christian-Industrial Complex* by Scott A. Bessenecker](http://www.ivpress.com/cgi-ivpress/book.pl/code=3680)
- [*Misreading Scripture with Western Eyes: Removing Cultural Blinders to Better Understand the Bible* by E. Randolph Richards and Brandon J. O'Brien](http://www.ivpress.com/cgi-ivpress/book.pl/code=3782)
- [*The World Is Not Ours to Save: Finding the Freedom to Do Good* by Tyler Wigg-Stevenson](http://www.ivpress.com/cgi-ivpress/book.pl/code=3657)
