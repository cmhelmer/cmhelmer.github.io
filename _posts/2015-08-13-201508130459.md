Wilson, a pastor and classical Christian educator, names nine authors to read:

- G.K. Chesterton
- H.L. Mencken
- P.G. Wodehouse
- T.S. Eliot
- J.R.R. Tolkien
- C.S. Lewis
- R.F. Capon
- M.S. Robinson
- N.D. Wilson

The final name on the list is Wilson’s son.

I’ve read some of N.D. Wilson’s books. His work isn’t *that* distinguished, but I certainly recommend reading him too.
