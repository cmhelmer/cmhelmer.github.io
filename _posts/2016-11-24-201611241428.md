I was taken aback by the conclusion of this article. I didnâ€™t expect *Kairos Journal* to overstep Scripture and state that academic education should be an *imperative* for pastors. I was confused that the author of the article seemed grateful for the example of the Puritan leaders who opposed a man as pastor who was pious and literate but academically unprepared.

The qualifications for pastors that the Scriptures give are of godly character and ability to teach. Theological education is good in as much as it can serve this end.
