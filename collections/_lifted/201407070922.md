# Not One Promise Will Fail

> Thus the LORD gave to Israel all the land that he swore to give to their fathers. And they took possession of it, and they settled there.
> 
> And the LORD gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their fathers. Not one of all their enemies had withstood them, for the LORD had given all their enemies into their hands.
> 
> Not one word of all the good promises that the LORD had made to the house of Israel had failed; all came to pass.
> 
> Joshua 21:43–45

Not one good promise had failed. “All” happened (and “all” happens six times in the original language of these verses).

How did God fulfill his promises? You know all that he brought Israel through, over 700 years from the time he first gave his word to Abraham (see [“Not a Single One Will Fail”](http://theblazingcenter.com/2015/05/not-a-single-one-will-fail.html)). And all this for a temporary land and a temporary rest (see Hebrews 4:8).

How much more will God fulfill his promises for us in Christ? How great is our eternal “Sabbath rest” (Heb. 4:9)!
