I went up to the roof this morning to take in this sight. I took S—— with me, who is almost 3. He was captivated by the large vehicle yard. “Wow! Look, daddy, trucks!” He even spotted the low-flying plane (can you?). “But son, what about the big and bright snow mountains?” Maybe this background is normal for him.

I grew up near Niagara Falls and always was in danger of finding the “wonder” commonplace because it was so near. What makes something wonderful? Is God less of a wonder because he would come near? Perhaps we take him for granted. But his presence makes the rest more wonderful.

I’m standing and pointing at those snow-caps. But S—— insists, “But trucks, daddy, my favorite!” and I come near to him. “Yes, son, those are one of my favorites, too.”
