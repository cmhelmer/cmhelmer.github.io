Steve sees five characteristics at the heart of the “movement” of the Southern Baptist Convention that keep it healthy. I agree with his assessment of the SBC and the significance of these beliefs:

> 1. The authority of Scripture
> 2. The primary missionary task
> 3. The independence of the local church
> 4. The priesthood of every believer
> 5. Descendants that can’t be counted
