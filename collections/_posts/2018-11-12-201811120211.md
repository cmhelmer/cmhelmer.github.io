[üìå Doug Ponder, ‚ÄúAre Missionaries Good for the World?‚Äù (Nov 8, 2018)](https://www.imb.org/2018/11/08/missionaries-good-for-world/)

> [M]issionaries are actually the greatest catalyst in the development and stability of nations.
> 
> Yet not just any missionaries.
> 
> Woodberry‚Äôs observations only held true for ‚Äúconversionary Protestants.‚Äù That is, missionaries (1) who preached the gospel with the intent of converting others and forming churches, (2) who encouraged everyone to read the Bible in the local language, and (3) who taught that salvation comes by grace through faith.

Ponder concludes from [Woodberry‚Äôs research](https://www.academia.edu/2128659/The_Missionary_Roots_of_Liberal_Democracy) that making disciples of Jesus Christ is the most effective way to improve the world.
