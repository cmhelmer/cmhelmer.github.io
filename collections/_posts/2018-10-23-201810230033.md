[📌 Justin Taylor, “John Frame’s 9-Point Checklist for Evaluating Theological Writings” (Oct 11, 2018)](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/justin-taylor/john-frames-9-point-checklist-evaluating-theological-writings/)

Besides nine that are positive, Frame tries to avoid three criteria that are inadequate reasons to critique theological writing:

1. Emphasis
2. Comparability
3. Terminology

I must still be young because these three don’t seem like criteria to avoid. If Frame means that these three criteria are not worth critiquing because they are not problems, but *symptoms* of problems, then it does seem like wise advice.

It’s worth the effort to understand work with which I disagree. Improper emphasis, comparability to other works that are poor, and unbiblical terminology are not the heart of the matter. They can be warning flags as well as an opportunity to learn the meaning behind another person’s expressions.
