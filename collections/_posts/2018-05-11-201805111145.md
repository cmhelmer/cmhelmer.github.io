If you seek to imitate the Apostle Paul as he imitated Christ, then consider these lessons from Galatians written by my friend John:

1. The message of our ministry is the gospel.
2. The challenge of our ministry is opposition to the gospel.
3. The motivation of our ministry is love.
4. The goal of our ministry is Christlikeness.
