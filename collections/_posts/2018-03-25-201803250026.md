March 21 is a UN-recognized special day, [World Down Syndrome Day](https://worlddownsyndromeday.org).

> This date provides a natural opportunity for Christians to advocate for their neighbors. We should help our communities see that individuals with Down syndrome offer meaningful contributions to our society, are inherently valuable, and deserve to be protected.
