[📌 Dave Hare, “3 Internet Accusations Against Missionaries” (Nov 25, 2018)](http://haretranslation.blogspot.com/2018/11/3-internet-accusations-against.html)

> Missionaries are not colonists, we are servants. We are not here to take, but to give. I don't want to own their land, make money off of their natural resources, or make them look or act like me. I don't want to control them, I don't even want to lead them. I want to help them, to give them access to God's Word, and the ability to read. I want them to see that eating too many mangoes does not cause malaria, but sleeping under a mosquito net helps. And I am doing my best to work myself out of a job. I want to see Kwakum men and women leading their own people in all of these things.
