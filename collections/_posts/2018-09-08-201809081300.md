[📌 Brian Phillips, “The Practical Magic of Joan Aiken, the Greatest Children’s Writer You’ve Likely Never Read,” *The New Yorker* (Aug 31, 2018)](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-practical-magic-of-joan-aiken-the-greatest-childrens-writer-youve-likely-never-read)

I enjoyed reading Aiken’s *The Wolves of Willoughby Chase* with the children. It had just the right touches of wit, adventure, trepidation, and justice. The article talks about her writing style as well as the time her family made home in a bus.
