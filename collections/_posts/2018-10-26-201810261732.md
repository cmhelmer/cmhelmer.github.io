[📌 Alan Jacobs, “Writing well ≠ dumbing down” (Oct 26, 2018)](https://blog.ayjay.org/writing-well-%E2%89%A0-dumbing-down/)

> The great difficulty is to make what you have to say as simple as possible *but no simpler* — which means that you often have to work very hard to express certain ideas in ways that are accessible but non-reductive. … when you’re writing for a general audience who does not know the language of your guild, you have to understand those concepts well enough to translate them into a more accessible idiom.

I have seen this ability in a few teachers and writers, and consider it a hallmark of a spiritual gift.
