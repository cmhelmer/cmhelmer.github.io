[📌 “Three Questions with Alistair Begg” *Towers* (Sep–Oct 2018)](http://equip.sbts.edu/publications/towers/towers-issue/2018/sep-oct-2018/three-questions-alistair-begg/)

On preaching:

1. Think yourself empty
2. Read yourself full
3. Write yourself clear
4. Pray yourself hot
5. Be yourself, but don’t preach yourself

> Freedom of delivery in the pulpit depends upon careful organization in the study. A good teacher clears the way, declares the way, and then gets out of the way.
> 
> … When the apostles did some reorganization of the early church, it was because they realized how crucial it was for them to give themselves continually to “prayer and the ministry of the word” (Acts 6:4). … We dare not divorce our preaching from our praying.
