[üìå ‚ÄúThree Questions with Alistair Begg‚Äù *Towers* (Sep‚ÄìOct 2018)](http://equip.sbts.edu/publications/towers/towers-issue/2018/sep-oct-2018/three-questions-alistair-begg/)

On sermon preparation:

1. Think yourself empty
2. Read yourself full
3. Write yourself clear
4. Pray yourself hot
5. Be yourself, but don‚Äôt preach yourself

> Freedom of delivery in the pulpit depends upon careful organization in the study. A good teacher clears the way, declares the way, and then gets out of the way.

On prayer and preaching:

> There is no change of fire in the pews if there is an iceberg in the pulpit.‚Ä¶ When the apostles did some reorganization of the early church, it was because they realized how crucial it was for them to give themselves continually to ‚Äúprayer and the ministry of the word‚Äù (Acts 6:4). ‚Ä¶ We dare not divorce our preaching from our praying.

Do both well.
