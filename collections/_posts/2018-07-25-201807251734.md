I also need to take notes quickly, not just to keep from forgetting, but even to determine if the information or idea is worth keeping. So I carry a memo book, or use the Notes app on my phone to jot things down without concern for formatting or filing. At the end of the day or week, I process what's significant into a tagged archive on my computer. The two activities: taking and accessing notes, are distinct goals and need separate environments. And to the two I'd add a third goal and environment: one for writing, for developing some of the notes into a new thing worth sharing.
