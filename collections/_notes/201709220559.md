# Edmund was healed and “could look you in the face”

> [Lucy] found [Edmund] standing on his feet and not only healed of his wounds but looking better than she had seen him look — oh, for ages; in fact ever since his first term at that horrid school which was where he had begun to go wrong. He had become his real old self again and could look you in the face. And there on the field of battle Aslan made him a knight.
> 
> —C.S. Lewis, “The Hunting of the White Stag,” *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe*

Edmund had been on the wrong side, but Aslan rescued and healed him. Lewis wrote that he “could look you in the face.” A mark of health.
