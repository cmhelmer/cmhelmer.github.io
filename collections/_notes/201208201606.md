# “Please, stop having quiet times”

> Please, stop having quiet times…. Twice our Sacred Book calls itself a sword (Hebrews 4:12, Ephesians 6:17).… A sword is only quiet when it's not being used…. Envision pages littered with “pen-tina” — not rust — but circles, underlines, notes, comments, prayers.…
> 
> The Sword of the Spirit takes no prisoners. It cuts through the thoughts and intentions of the heart. It calls our bluff. It swacks through the jungle of fig leaf weeds and shows what's really there — what's hidden, phony, self-righteous, and where the gospel of grace is needed. Reverberations of the Sword's presence spill out on our lives. Nuclear bombs envy the force of the Word.
