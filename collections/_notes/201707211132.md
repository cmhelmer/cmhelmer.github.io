# Personal Knowledge Base: “An enlarged intimate supplement to his memory”

> Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library. … [A] device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.

> —Vannevar Bush, “As We May Think,” *The Atlantic Monthly* (July 1945), 101-108. As quoted in [“Personal knowledge base,” Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_base).

Vannevar Bush described an electronic utility he called, “Memex.” It was meant to be a personal knowledge base to handle information overload and new challenges people would face post-WWII.

I was struck by each word of his description of the system as “an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.”
