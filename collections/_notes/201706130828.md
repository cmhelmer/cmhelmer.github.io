# Apple System Fonts

In CSS:

	font-family: -apple-system, sans-serif;

There are other names to access the system font on older macOS versions (when it was OS X). See, for example, GitHub’s CSS for a full stack of system fonts. For my use case — local Markdown preview and export — `-apple-system` is enough.

The San Francisco font family is complete, having italics, all weights, small-caps, and a wide Unicode range.

There’s also:

- `".SF Compact"`
- `".SF Compact Rounded"`
- `".SF Compact Text"`
- `".SF UI Display Condensed"`
- `".SF UI Text Condensed"`
- `".SF Mono"`

I couldn’t reference `".SF UI …"` in CSS. “SF Mono” is bundled in the `Terminal.app` package. Some of the fonts are available for [download at the Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) site.
