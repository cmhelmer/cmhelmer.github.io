# “Ministerial Friendships and Longevity”: Summary

Summary of [Joe Holland, “Ministerial Friendships and Longevity,” at *The Christward Collective*](http://www.alliancenet.org/christward/ministerial-friendships-and-longevity).

> … I’ve come to believe that there at least two givens and one blind spot when it comes to guarding against ministry burnout. Consider the following:
> 
> The first given characterizing the pastors that I know is that they study hard. … [W]e are not going to leave the ministry because we’ve lost our theological moorings. … [P]art of the reason we continue in ministry is due to an insatiable intellectual interest in the things of God and a desire to teach them to others.
> 
> The second given is that pastors in our circles usually work hard — fingers-to-the-bone hard. … These men may burn out from exhaustion, but they won’t quit because they’re bored.
> 
> So, for pastors that think hard and work hard, what more do they need to look out for? Can these two “givens” get them through a lifetime of pastoral ministry? The easy answer is no. Isolation can be an unexpected and crippling characteristic of a minister who is both orthodox and faithful. That is why ministers need to check their relational blind spot to ensure sustained ministry health. …
> 
> Don’t let a blind spot be your undoing. Think hard, work hard, and cultivate lasting friendships.
