# Color Is Not a Universal Language

What color of flower do you give to your beloved? What color do you wear to a funeral? Which colors are for boys and which are for girls? The answers to these questions are not universal. Cultures don’t respond to colors in the same way.

If you’re depending upon a color to carry meaning (such as with a “Wordless Book” gospel presentation), first ask your audience, “What do you think of when you see this color? What is it used for?” Take care when you use color so that you do not miscommunicate across cultures.

See the graphic below to get an idea of how some culture’s perceive color.
