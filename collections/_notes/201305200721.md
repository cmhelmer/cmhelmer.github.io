# Color Is Not a Universal Language

What color of flower do you give to your love? What color do you wear to a funeral? Which colors are for boys and which are for girls? There are not universal answers. The world doesn’t think and feel the same way about a color. 

If you’re depending upon a color to carry meaning (such as with a “Wordless Book” gospel presentation), first ask your audience, “What do you think of when you see this color?” Take care when you use color so that you do not miscommunicate across cultures.

See the graphic below to get an idea of how some culture’s perceive color.
