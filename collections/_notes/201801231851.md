# Markup for “kramdown”

The static site generator Jekyll on GitHub Pages uses “kramdown” as the Markdown renderer. It converts a superset of Markdown.

Below are examples of all available structural elements that can be used in a kramdown text, taken from [kramdown Quick Reference](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html) (excluding “Block Attributes,” “Inline Attributes” and “Extensions”). There is also more information at [kramdown Syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html). This reference is for kramdown version 1.16.2, the version used by GitHub Pages at this time. 

The example markup is also useful for testing that the Jekyll theme in use styles the output.

# Kramdown Reference

## Block-level Elements

### Paragraphs

Consecutive lines of text are considered to be one paragraph. As with other block level elements you have to add a blank line to separate it from the following block-level element:

	The first paragraph.
	
	Another paragraph.

<div class="output">
The first paragraph.

Another paragraph.
</div>

Explicit line breaks in a paragraph can be made by using two spaces or two backslashes at the end of a line:

	This is a paragraph  
	which contains a hard line break.

<div class="output">
This is a paragraph  
which contains a hard line break.
</div>

### Headers

kramdown supports Setext style headers and atx style headers. A header must always be preceded by a blank line except at the beginning of the document:

	First level header
	==================
	
	Second level header
	-------------------

<div class="output">
First level header
==================

Second level header
-------------------
</div>

	# Heading 1
	## Heading 2
	### Heading 3
	#### Heading 4
	##### Heading 5
	###### Heading 6

<div class="output">
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
</div>

### Blockquotes

A blockquote is started using the `>` marker followed by an optional space; all following lines that are also started with the blockquote marker belong to the blockquote. You can use any block-level elements inside a blockquote:

	> A sample blockquote.
	>
	> > Nested blockquotes are also possible.
	>
	> ## Headers work too
	> This is the outer quote again.

<div class="output">
> A sample blockquote.
> 
> > Nested blockquotes are also possible.
> 
> ## Headers work too
> This is the outer quote again.
</div>

You may also be lazy with the `>` markers as long as there is no blank line:

	> This is a blockquote
	continued on this
	and this line.
	
	But this is a separate paragraph.

<div class="output">
> This is a blockquote
continued on this
and this line.

But this is a separate paragraph.
</div>

### Code Blocks

kramdown supports two different code block styles. One uses lines indented with either four spaces or one tab whereas the other uses lines with tilde characters as delimiters — therefore the content does not need to be indented:

	This is a sample code block.

	~~~~~~
	This is also a code block.
	~~~
	Ending lines must have at least as
	many tildes as the starting line.
	~~~~~~~~~~~~

<div class="output">
~~~~~~
This is also a code block.
~~~
Ending lines must have at least as
many tildes as the starting line.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
</div>

The following is a code block with a language specified:

	~~~ ruby
	def what?
		42
	end
	~~~

<div class="output">
~~~ ruby
def what?
	42
end
~~~
</div>

### Lists

kramdown supports ordered and unordered lists. Ordered lists are started by using a number followed by a period, a space and then the list item text. The content of a list item consists of block-level elements. All lines which have the same indent as the text of the line with the list marker belong to the list item:

	1. This is a list item
	2. And another item
	2. And the third one
		with additional text

<div class="output">
1. This is a list item
2. And another item
2. And the third one
	with additional text
</div>

As with block quotes, you may be lazy when using the list item marker:

	* A list item
	with additional text

<div class="output">
* A list item
with additional text
</div>

As the content consists of block-level elements you can do things like the following:

	1.  This is a list item
	
		> with a blockquote
	
		## And a header
	
	2.  Followed by another item

<div class="output">
1.  This is a list item

> with a blockquote

## And a header

2.  Followed by another item
</div>

Nested lists are also easy to create:

	1. Item one
	   1. sub item one
	   2. sub item two
	   3. sub item three
	2. Item two

<div class="output">
1. Item one
	1. sub item one
	2. sub item two
	3. sub item three
2. Item two
</div>

Lists can occur directly after other block-level elements, however, there has to be at least one blank line if you want to follow a paragraph with a list:

	This is a paragraph.
	1. This is NOT a list.
	
	1. This is a list!

<div class="output">
This is a paragraph.
1. This is NOT a list.

1. This is a list!
</div>

Unordered lists are started by using an asterisk, a dash or a plus sign (they can be mixed) and a space. Apart from that unordered lists follow the same rules as ordered lists:

	* Item one
	+ Item two
	- Item three

<div class="output">
* Item one
+ Item two
- Item three
</div>

### Definition Lists

A definition list works similar to a normal list and is used to associate definitions with terms. Definition lists are started when a normal paragraph is followed by a line starting with a colon and then the definition text. One term can have many definitions and multiple terms can have the same definition. Each line of the preceding paragraph is assumed to contain one term, for example:

	term
	: definition
	: another definition
	
	another term
	and another term
	: and a definition for the term

<div class="output">
term
: definition
: another definition

another term
and another term
: and a definition for the term
</div>

If you insert a blank line before a definition (note: there must only be one blank line between the terms and the first definition), the definition will be wrapped in a paragraph:

	term
	
	: definition
	: definition

<div class="output">
term

: definition
: definition
</div>

Each term can be styled using span-level elements and each definition is parsed as block-level elements, i.e. you can use any block-level in a definition. Just use the same indent for the lines following the definition line:

	This *is* a term
	
	: This will be a paragraph
		
		> a blockquote
		
		## A header

<div class="output">
This *is* a term

: This will be a paragraph
	
	> a blockquote
	
	## A header
</div>

### Tables

kramdown supports a syntax for creating simple tables. A line starting with a pipe character (`|`) starts a table row. However, if the pipe characters is immediately followed by a dash (`-`), a separator line is created. Separator lines are used to split the table header from the table body (and optionally align the table columns) and to split the table body into multiple parts. If the pipe character is followed by an equal sign (`=`), the tables rows below it are part of the table footer.

	| A simple | table |
	| with multiple | lines |

<div class="output">

| A simple | table |
| with multiple | lines |

</div>

	| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
	|:---------|:--------:|---------:|
	| cell 1   | cell 2   | cell 3   |
	| cell 4   | cell 5   | cell 6   |
	|----
	| cell 1   | cell 2   | cell 3   |
	| cell 4   | cell 5   | cell 6   |
	|=====
	| foot 1   | foot 2   | foot 3

<div class="output">

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|:---------|:--------:|---------:|
| cell 1   | cell 2   | cell 3   |
| cell 4   | cell 5   | cell 6   |
|----
| cell 1   | cell 2   | cell 3   |
| cell 4   | cell 5   | cell 6   |
|=====
| Foot 1   | Foot 2   | Foot 3

</div>

### HTML Elements

kramdown allows you to use block-level HTML tags (div, p, pre, …) to markup whole blocks of text — just start a line with a block-level HTML tag. kramdown syntax is normally not processed inside an HTML tag but this can be changed with the `parse_block_html` option. If this options is set to `true`, then the content of a block-level HTML tag is parsed by kramdown either as block level or span-level text, depending on the tag:

	{::options parse_block_html="false" /}
	
	<div style="float: right">
	Something that stays right and is not wrapped in a paragraph.
	</div>
	
	{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
	
	<div>
	This is wrapped in a paragraph.
	</div>
	<p>
	This can contain only *span* level elements.
	</p>

<div class="output">
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

<div style="float: right">
Something that stays right and is not wrapped in a paragraph.
</div>

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div>
This is wrapped in a paragraph.
</div>
<p>
This can contain only *span* level elements.
</p>
</div>

## Span-Level Elements

### Emphasis

Emphasis can be added to text by surrounding the text with either asterisks or underscores:

	This is *emphasized*, _this_ too!

<div class="output">
This is *emphasized*, _this_ too!
</div>

Strong emphasis can be done by doubling the delimiters:

	This is **strong**, __this__ too!

<div class="output">
This is **strong**, __this__ too!
</div>

The form with the asterisks can also be used to markup parts of words:

	This w**ork**s as expected!

<div class="output">
This w**ork**s as expected!
</div>

### Links

A simple link can be created by surrounding the text with square brackets and the link URL with parentheses:

	A [link](http://kramdown.gettalong.org) to the kramdown homepage.

<div class="output">
A [link](http://kramdown.gettalong.org) to the kramdown homepage.
</div>

You can also add title information to the link:

	A [link](http://kramdown.gettalong.org "hp") to the homepage.

<div class="output">
A [link](http://kramdown.gettalong.org "hp") to the homepage.
</div>

There is another way to create links which does not interrupt the text flow. The URL and title are defined using a reference name and this reference name is then used in square brackets instead of the link URL:

	A [link][kramdown hp] to the homepage.
	
	[kramdown hp]: http://kramdown.gettalong.org "hp"

<div class="output">
A [link][kramdown hp] to the homepage.

[kramdown hp]: http://kramdown.gettalong.org "hp"
</div>

If the link text itself is the reference name, the second set of square brackets can be omitted:

	A link to the [kramdown hp].
	
	[kramdown hp]: http://kramdown.gettalong.org "hp"

<div class="output">
A link to the [kramdown hp].

[kramdown hp]: http://kramdown.gettalong.org "hp"
</div>

### Images

Images can be created in a similar way: just use an exclamation mark before the square brackets. The link text will become the alternative text of the image and the link URL specifies the image source:

	An image: ![grass](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/img/image.jpg)

<div class="output">
An image: ![grass](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/img/image.jpg)
</div>

### Inline Code

Text phrases can be easily marked up as code by surrounding them with backticks:

	Use `Kramdown::Document.new(text).to_html` to convert the text in kramdown syntax to HTML.

<div class="output">
Use `Kramdown::Document.new(text).to_html` to convert the text in kramdown syntax to HTML.
</div>

If you want to use literal backticks in your code, just use two or more backticks as delimiters. The space right after the beginning delimiter and the one right before the closing delimiter are ignored:

	Use backticks to markup code, e.g. `` `code` ``.

<div class="output">
Use backticks to markup code, e.g. `` `code` ``.
</div>

### Footnotes

Footnotes can easily be used in kramdown. Just set a footnote marker (consists of square brackets with a caret and the footnote name inside) in the text and somewhere else the footnote definition (which basically looks like a reference link definition):

	This is a text with a footnote.[^1]
	
	[^1]: And here is the definition.

<div class="output">
This is a text with a footnote.[^1]

[^1]: And here is the definition.
</div>

The footnote definition can contain any block-level element, all lines following a footnote definition indented with four spaces or one tab belong to the definition:

	This is a text with a footnote.[^2]
	
	[^2]:
		And here is the definition.
	
		> With a quote!

<div class="output">
This is a text with a footnote.[^1][^2]

[^2]:
	And here is the definition.
	
	> With a quote!
</div>

As can be seen above the footnote name is only used for the anchors and the numbering is done automatically in document order. Repeated footnote markers will link to the same footnote definition.

### Abbreviations

Abbreviations will work out of the box once you add an abbreviation definition. So you can just write the text and add the definitions later on.

	This is an HTML example.
	
	*[HTML]: Hypertext Markup Language

<div class="output">
This is an HTML example.
	
*[HTML]: Hypertext Markup Language
</div>

### HTML Elements

HTML is not only supported on the block-level but also on the span-level:

	This is <span style="color: tomato">written in tomato</span>.

<div class="output">
This is <span style="color: tomato">written in tomato</span>.
</div>

## Notes

- kramdown also renders checklists (`- [ ]`, `- [x]` or `1. [ ]`) as disabled and checked checkboxes:

	- [ ] do
	- [x] done
	
	And:
	
	1. [ ] do this first
	2. [x] done

- kramdown does not process `::` for `<mark>` (highlights), as in `::highlighted::` (but this Jekyll theme filters for marks):

	::highlight::

- It doesn’t output `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` for Markdown images with descriptions (`![image description](/some/img.jpg)`) and it won’t render figure tags in the Markdown when `parse_block_html` is `true` (but this Jekyll theme filters for images with descriptions and renders figures in their place):

	![grass](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/img/image.jpg)

- It doesn’t handle audio or video, so put those html elements directly in Markdown (with download link as fallback for older browsers): `<video src="" controls><a href="" download>Download video</a></video>` and `<audio src="" controls><a href="" download>Download audio</a></audio>`
