# “Writers to Read”: Wilson and Sons

🔖 Douglas Wilson, *Writers to Read: Nine Names That Belong on Your Bookshelf*

Wilson, a pastor and classical Christian educator, names nine authors to read:

- G.K. Chesterton
- H.L. Mencken
- P.G. Wodehouse
- T.S. Eliot
- J.R.R. Tolkien
- C.S. Lewis
- R.F. Capon
- M.S. Robinson
- N.D. Wilson

I wondered about the last author until I learned it was Wilson’s son. Wilson is the Psalm 127 man. He holds his children like a warrior his arrows and stands unashamed at the city gates. He puts his son in league with great writers even before he reached middle-age.

So before I raised a red flag of nepotism, I checked out N.D. Wilson. While I wouldn’t say that his work is *that* distinguished, who’s to say he isn’t great? He has initials in his name.

I benefitted from his writing and so have my children. I recommend reading him too.
