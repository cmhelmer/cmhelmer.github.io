# “Small Tweaks That Can Make a Huge Impact on Your Website’s Accessibility”

Summary of the article by Andy Bell, “[Small Tweaks That Can Make a Huge Impact on Your Website’s Accessibility](https://css-tricks.com/small-tweaks-can-make-huge-impact-websites-accessibility/),” January 11, 2018.

1. **Document Structure and Semantics:**
	1. **Use a Single `<main>` Element:** Help screen readers and add a skip link (and a `:focus` style) to it.
	2. **Use Elements Appropriately:** Use `<button>` for interactive elements and get keyboard events for free.
	3. **Get Your Heading Hierarchy Locked-Down:** Help screen readers navigate pages with a nice structure of `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.
2. **Get Your Color Contrast Right:** Use tools to get a compliant contrast ratio of at least `4.5:1` for text and `3:1` for headings.
3. **Responsible Text Labels:** Use attribute `aria-label` to give context to labels and links.
4. **Small Typography Tweaks With a Big Impact:**
	1. Size body content at `16px` minimum, and line-height at around `1.5`. 
	2. Highlight key words and phrases.
	3. Use ligatures and decorative elements only in headings; sans-serif fonts are better for readers with dyslexia.
5. **Enhance Keyboard Support:**
	1. Allow the escape key to hide dialogues.
	2. Use the `:focus` pseudo-selector to add obvious state changes.
6. **Don’t Rely on Color Alone to Communicate State Changes**
