# Mel-AHN-cho-ly

We rented and watched the movie, *Megamind*, with the kids a few Friday nights ago. Megamind is an alien who loved big words and pronounced them badly. He wanted to be the villain of *metrosity* (“Metro City”).

There was another word of his that we can’t say with chuckling, “melancholy”:

	mel-AHN-cho-ly  
	/mɛlˈɑnkəli/

The mispronunciation of “melancholy” lifts some of its heaviness.
