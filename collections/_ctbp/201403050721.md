# Storytelling and Translation Podcast

When you aspire to make disciples of all nations, you must prepare to work among people who cannot read and leave them with what they need to carry on the work. The [story4all](http://www.story4all.com/) podcast provided a testimony and summary of one worker’s approach in Southeast Asia that considers orality, written translation and church planting. If you’re preparing your strategy now, think about how to bring these together.

Below is the audio of [“Story and Translation, Part 1”](http://story4all.libsyn.com/s4a161-story-translation-pt-1) (and here's [Part 2](http://story4all.libsyn.com/s4a161-story-translation-pt-1)).
