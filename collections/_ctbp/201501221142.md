# Mascot Mash-up

Church Planting Bible Translators needs a mascot! One of us once suggested a mash-up of two animals for a logo. But isn’t this the question we’ve been asking: why stitch together two beasts when one will do? Here are seven curious, warm-blooded contenders:

- There’s the zebra-giraffe, native to the rainforests of Central Africa: the [Okapi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi).
- Of course, the duck-beaver, the egg-laying, venomous-spurred, electro-sensing icon of Australia: the [Platypus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platypus).
- The bear-cat, hailing from South and Southeast Asia and already mascot of several U.S. universities: the [Binturong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binturong).
- The elephant-pig, which, according to oriental folklore, eats people’s nightmares: the [Tapir](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapir).
- The goat-antelope, national animal of Bhutan and what one biologist likened to a “bee-stung moose”: the [Takin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takin).
- And the snake-anteater, which rolls up its scaly self and defends against lions: the [Pangolin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin).

But perhaps the one that suits CTBP best is the [Sengi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengi). This shrew-like mammal has the trunk of an elephant and the bound of a rabbit.

The sengi may be the closest thing to what [one church planter suggested in jest](http://www.churchplanting.com/elephant-or-rabbit/): an elephabbit (my family preferred the name “rabbiphant” when surveyed over dinner), with rapid reproduction, low maintenance and massive strength. Of course it would be injurious to both breeds to try it (not to mention the breeder).

The reproductive behavior of elephants and rabbits are compared in an analogy used by CPM practitioners: Put two elephants in a room together and in three years you may have one baby elephant; put two rabbits together in a room for the same amount of time… (*Small Is Big!: Unleashing the Big Impact of Intentionally Small Churches*). The idea is that large, complex things are difficult to reproduce. But this analogy may misconstrue the point of biblical church planting, as [BHM wrote at CTBP](http://ctbp.org/an-appeal-for-god-driven-missions/).

Ironically, sengis are classified with elephants, not with shrews and rabbits. But I won't stretch the metaphor further. In fact, I may have seen one scamper away earlier while I was out plowing.
