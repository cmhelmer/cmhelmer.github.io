# Border Training

Returned from a three-day training at the border. Some reports and requests from the disciples: “I’ve been working for you for months… when will I get paid?” “Who’s the great commission for? If for us, can we baptize?” “People said, ‘You must have gone to heaven and brought back these stories.’”

We’ve given this group [[201307242209 the Kingdom Story]], a set of stories expanding this good news, and [[201401210851 a discipleship process]]. This time we went back and strengthened these things. I left feeling that it was done in a way that strengthened people and not just products.
