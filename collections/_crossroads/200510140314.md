# Crossroads: This Weekend

Hi family,

Here’s what we have going on this weekend:

- On Saturday, we are providing dinner for the Intl. BSU. Meet at 4pm at the BSU, before SNT, for dinner preparation (bring a good knife with you).
- On Sunday, we have a church meeting at 3pm at H——’s apartment.

Pray and prepare even now for the meeting; we will discuss membership, finances, vision. H—— will bring a report on the finances. Also, here is a specific request for prayer: M——’s grandfather passed away last weekend. We had been praying for him before; please continue praying for the family.

Have a good week. I look forward to seeing all of you again,  
C.
