# A Time to Pray for a Brother

Dear Church,

A brother needs your prayers. J—— is facing some legal issues that keep him from working. He will need an attorney to represent him. This is an unexpected and very trying time for J——.

Pray! We are grateful to have such a church family that knows about each other’s difficulties and cares. We thank God that J——’s faith remains strong. Pray God would grant J—— wisdom, peace, and a teachable spirit in the coming days.

Thank you,  
C.

> As for you, O Lord, you will not restrain your mercy from me;  
> Your steadfast love and your faithfulness will ever preserve me!  
> For evils have encompassed me beyond number;  
> Our iniquities have overtaken me, and I cannot see;  
> They are more than the hairs of my head; my heart fails me.
> 
> Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me! O Lord, make haste to help me!  
> Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether who seek to snatch away my life;  
> Let those be turned back and brought to dishonor who desire my hurt!  
> Let those be appalled because of their shame  
> Who say to me, “Aha, Aha!”
> 
> But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you;  
> May those who love your salvation say continually, “Great is the Lord!”  
> As for me, I are poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me.  
> You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God!
> 
> —Psalms 40:11–17
