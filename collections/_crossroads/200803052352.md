# Special Baptism Service This Sunday at 4pm

Crossroads,

“Consider yourself dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. Walk in the newness of life!” (Romans 6). That is what we will tell Liwei when she is baptized this Sunday.

Come to a special baptism service before our regular Sunday worship. We will meet as we did one year ago, at Third Avenue Baptist Church building:

And don’t forget to change your clocks this Sunday morning. Add one hour. And then come early one more hour at 4pm to celebrate new life.

To know Jesus and Him crucified,  
C.
