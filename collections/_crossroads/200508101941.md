# Thursday Lunch, Prayer and Fasting

Crossroads Family,

This is an announcement and invitation. This Thursday (8/11) lunchtime will be set aside for prayer and fasting. Our church has decided to dedicate this time to focus on the Lord before the new semester begins. More specifically, pray to God that every international student at U of L would hear, understand, and respond to the gospel.

See you all Saturday… and I’ll be praying with you tomorrow,  
C.
