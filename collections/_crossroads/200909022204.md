# Church on the go this Sunday… to J—— and S——’s wedding!

Church,

J——and S——are getting married this Sunday, September 6! The wedding will be at 3pm at S——’s grandmother’s house in Tennessee.

There will be no regular church meeting at our home this Sunday. Instead, meet at our apartment at 10am so you can all drive together. The drive is 4 hours.

Hope to see you there,  
C.
