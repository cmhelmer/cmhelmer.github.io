# Conference Messages on “Scripture”

I promised some of you these audio messages. K—— and I recently attended a Christian conference called New Attitude. It was saturated with grace. The theme this year was “Scripture” (“If the Bible really is God’s Word, then we’re called to delight in it and obey it”). Last year we attended with H—— before he left for East Asia.

We recommend all the messages. Especially: “The Troubled Soul” about how to speak God’s Word to yourself (instead of listening to yourself); “William Tyndale,” about the man who was killed for translating the Bible for the first time into modern English (this is the legacy of your English Bible: translating it so that we could understand the gospel came at great cost!); and “Fighting for Faith with God’s Word,” full of practical ways to fight temptation with the Word as your sword.

K—— and I wanted to pass on to you what was an incredible gift to us.
