# Meeting at BCM This Sunday, 6/24

Church,

Come to the BCM building on the University campus this Sunday for our church meeting. We will welcome a friend of Crossroads, P——. He is a part of a great ministry in the Philippines and is studying now at The Master’s Seminary in California.

Please pray for the Dallas mission trip. For those of you who are going, I will buy tickets at the end of this week. Let me know if you have any questions. I am eager to go!

This week a few of us have been enjoying the VBS children’s ministry. Thanks E——, J——, B—— and M—— for your help so far. Thanks again K——, for coordinating volunteers.

W—— and W—— will be returning soon, and H—— is now overseas. He is visiting his family and is away from us, but not in spirit! H——, I cried when you left. You’re the only Chinese guy we ever saw with tears. If fellowship with God’s people is so sweet now, who can know the richness of being in God’s family for eternity? Times like these prepare us all the more for heaven. Labor to get other people into this family!

Let us know if you have any needs or news.

See you all soon,  
C.
