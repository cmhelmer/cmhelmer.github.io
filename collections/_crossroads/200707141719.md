Crossroads family,

Remember us this week! B—— and E——, L—— and the Helmers will be working with D—— in Dallas. Remember us before the Father often! Remember us for His own glory! Remember us for your own joy!

The others are already in Dallas. We write from K——’s parents in Oklahoma and will join them tomorrow.

M——, J—— and others will be leaving for Indonesia also. We need wisdom to know how to love God and love others publicly. We know God wants to be known. He has given us His Word and His Son to show it. We know He will complete the work.

Amen! See you soon, Lord willing,  
The Helmers
